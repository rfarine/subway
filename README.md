Pick 2 intersection train lines, 9 stations on each line. (total of 17 stations, because of the overlap).

write a ruby program, that will ask the user:

"What station are you starting at?"
"What station are you going to?"

then it will give directions:

ride the 'L' train for 3 stops and get off at X"
ride the 'L' train for 2 stops, transfer to the M train, ride it for X stops to Y"
